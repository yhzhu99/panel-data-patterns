# Visualization of Different Treatment Patterns in Panel Data

## Overview

This repository provides visualizations for various treatment patterns in panel data. These patterns are crucial in understanding the application of treatments across different units and time periods, which is essential for causal inference and ATT (Average Treatment effect on the Treated) estimation.

## Visualizations

The HTML file `index.html` included in this project visualizes the following treatment patterns:

1. **Randomized Treated**: Treatment is randomly assigned to units at different times.
2. **Block-wise**: Treatment is applied in blocks, where groups of units receive treatment simultaneously.
3. **Staggered**: Treatment is staggered over time, with units entering the treatment phase at different time points.
4. **Block-wise Combined Staggered Treated Units**: A specific pattern where treated units are combined in a block-wise and staggered manner, particularly concentrated at the top-right corner of the table.
